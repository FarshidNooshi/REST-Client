# Rest Client

REST Client is a method or a tool to invoke a REST service API that is exposed for communication by any system or service provider. For example: if an API is exposed to get real time traffic information about a route from Google, the software/tool that invokes the Google traffic API is called the REST client
Like Insomnia & Postman.
